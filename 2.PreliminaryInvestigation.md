# Preliminary investigation

At this point, you have a research topic, which may or may not be stated as a claim.

## The goal: a precise, significant claim

The goal of your preliminary investigation is to transform your topic or rough claim into a precise, significant claim.

A **claim** is a sentence that asserts something that might or might not be true. (Sometimes is is called your "thesis".) Because your goal is to convince your audience that the claim is true, it must be reasonably possible for the claim to be false. If the truth of the statement is known or widely believed, there is no convincing for you to do.

A *precise* claim uses specific language and avoids vague descriptions. It is objective. Because your goal is to convince your audience that the claim is true, you want the claim to be well defined, without ambiguity.

A *significant* claim is one that matters to your audience. Because your goal is to convince your audience that the claim is true, you want them to have enough interest in the claim that they will stick around long enough to consider your argument.

Rarely, you can state a precise, significant claim at the beginning of your research effort. If you are lucky enough to be in that situation, skip the rest of this file, and proceed directly to the next step.

## Getting from topic to claim

In most cases, you will need to do some preliminary investigation to get from a topic sentence to a claim, or to get from an initial, rough claim to one that is precise and significant.

Because this is an exploratory process, shaped partly by your own interests, it is impossible to provide a detailed road map. However, there are some pointers to help you avoid getting lost.

In simple terms, you want to learn as much about your topic area as necessary to reach the goal (a precise, significant claim), *but no more*. It is easy to make the mistake of gathering as much information as you can about your topic area, without being selective. Remember that your goal is not to collect facts for an exhaustive report; the goal is to write a claim that becomes the starting point for a convincing argument.

At this point, you should feel free to imagine and speculate. It is not important for you to limit your reading to peer-reviewed or authoritative information sources. You can certainly use them, but anything that helps you get to a precise, significant claim is good--  reference works, YouTube videos, podcasts, science fiction, you name it. (Later, when you begin to collect evidence, the emphasis will be on appropriate authoritative sources.)

Often, a good claim is a proposed answer to a question. So, it may help you to brainstorm questions about your topic area.

### Brainstorming questions

Here are some suggestions for brainstorming questions about your topic. In the space below, list as many questions as you can think of. Don't worry about the quality or usefulness of the questions; just capture as many ideas as you can without evaluating them.

- [ ] Consider questions that ask who, what, when, where, and especially how and why.
- [ ] Consider questions about the history of your topic.
- [ ] Consider questions that ask how your topic fits into the context of some larger structure or system.
- [ ] Consider questions that ask how the parts of your topic fit together.
- [ ] Consider questions that ask how your topic can be grouped into kinds.
- [ ] Consider questions that ask how your topic can be compared and contrasted with others like it.
- [ ] Consider "what if?" or other speculative questions.

### Evaluate the questions

Some of the questions you brainstormed will be better than others. Here are some criteria for evaluating questions.

- Weaker questions can be answered by established facts that you can just look up.
- Weaker questions cannot be answered well, because they are too subjective (opinion-based), or because too little objective evidence is likely to be available.
- Weaker questions are likely to have answers that get a "boring, don't care" response from the audience.
- Stronger questions are likely to have answers that help us think about a larger issue that is worth understanding better.
- Stronger questions are likely to have answers that help solve important practical problems.
- Stronger questions are likely to have answers that would require the audience to change their minds about issues they consider settled.

In the space below, record the stronger questions, which you will use to guide you. (Suggestion: cut the stronger questions from the brainstorming list above, and paste them here. Leave the weaker questions in place above in case you need to return to them.)

## From question to claim

Look at the stronger questions and imagine ways that you might answer them. Try writing each imagined answer in the form of a claim-- a statement that may or may not be true. Are the claims precise? Significant?

### Iterate as needed

If you haven't yet arrived at a claim, make another lap. That is, look for more information-- especiall anthing that suggests different answers to the questions you wrote, or leads to related questions. If necessary, use the information to brainstorm and evaluate more questions.
